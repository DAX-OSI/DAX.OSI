Developer API Extensions Operating System Interface.

What is DAX OSI?
DAX OSI stands for 'Developer API Extensions Operating System Interface' (OSI) and runs alongside windows as a stand
alone instance to transform your OS into a whole new look and feel. DAX OSI is a very simplistic, yet elegant touch to
change things up on your desktop. DAX OSI is also Open Source which has its own GitHub repository for anyone to download
and create your own OSI just the way you want it. Operating systems should be exactly how YOU want it, not with all the 
clutter and things you don’t want!

How do I use DAX OSI?
It’s simple! You can simply download the binaries and just run it DAX OSI straight out of the box OR you can download the source
and compile it yourself to further customize DAX OSI and create your own distribution to share with others, or develop yourself.

Is there any documentation?

Currently documentation is being written for the key points of DAX OSI. Everything within the source is in some way a derivative
of the windows shell and components used in Visual Studio/.NET Framework, however; with the addition of some special parameters
for 'Windows.Controls' to allow for special effects, smoothness, and fast runtimes without flashing of controls, visual latency, etc.
It will also cover how to use the scripting language DAX OSI uses. Updated over time, the documentation is far from complete.
